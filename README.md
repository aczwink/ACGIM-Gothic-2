# ACGIM-Gothic-2
An improvement mod for the game "Gothic 2: Night of the Raven" by "Piranha Bytes"

## Concepts

### Playing Guildless
One of the things that I didn't like is that you are forced into a guild very early in the game.
While this definetely made sense for the original game, it does not for the addon.
I found it especially annoying to become a mage and then dress like a pirate or bandit in Jahrkendar.
On the other hand, playing through the whole game without choosing a guild is not enjoyable for me, since a big part of the whole game would be missing.
For me, Jahrkendar logically should be played before going to chapter 2.
Going first to chapter 2 and then coming back and seeing the whole crisis going on and then you can not continue because the stupid Vatras does not want to leave the city on its own.
Then one has to rush through Jahrkendar just to get back fast to the real story.
As soon as you are in chapter 2, you're in the main story and Jahrkendar is of no importance anymore.
On the other hand, Jahrkendar is a place where you are a member of many groups (Ring of Water, Pirates, Bandits) and that just fits the whole "Hey, I just came out of the colony".

Therefore one can now go to Lord Hagen without having a guild (one still has to trick the guards for example with a sleep spell).
One can tell him about the dragons but he will refuse to instruct you on bringing him proof until you are member of a guild.
However, for Vatras it is now sufficient if you brought him the message - Lord Hagen decided to do nothing until he has a proof.
Thats his decision and the message was delivered - thats what was important to Vatras.

## Known issues
-Several speech files are missing in NotR: See issue #2
